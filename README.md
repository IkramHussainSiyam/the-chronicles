# 📝 The Chronicles – Full-stack writing platform.

> ⚠️ **Status: Pending**  
> This project is currently In Progress.

A full-stack writing platform where users can read, write and share their stories with the world & connect with each other by following.

## 🔍 About the Project

**The Chronicles** began as a full-stack Medium clone, but this release focuses on frontend implementation to demonstrate high-quality UI, layout precision, and component-driven architecture using modern tooling.

This is not a static prototype — it’s a foundation. As I advance technically, the codebase will evolve into a full-featured application.

> ✅ Fully responsive layout  
> 🎯 Pixel-perfect design accuracy  
> 🌒 Dark & light theme support  
> 🔗 Multipage architecture (not a single-page mockup)

## 💼 Portfolio Integration

This project is part of my live portfolio. It demonstrates design capability, scalable architecture planning, and readiness to integrate cutting-edge tools. The goal is not just to ship a clone — but to build a modular, production-grade platform over time.
